Export a moveset by loading up the target character, then clicking the wanted export button. Movesets loaded using "Import to P1/P2" will be unloaded after the next loading screen.
If you want the moveset to stay constantly, use the "Online Player" buttons, and BEFORE the loading screen. Both online players must load the same moveset on the same players.

- Using only 'Set Online Local' OR 'Set Online Remote' alone will not properly track side changes. Use BOTH at once for proper behaviour.
