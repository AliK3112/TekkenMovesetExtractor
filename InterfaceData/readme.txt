Export a moveset by loading up the target character, then clicking the wanted export button. Movesets loaded using "Import to P1/P2" will be unloaded after the next loading screen.
If you want the moveset to stay constantly, use the "Online Player" buttons, and BEFORE the loading screen. Both online players must load the same moveset on the same players.
 1.0.22 Changelog:
- [EDITOR] Show max value in 'Go to' menus
- [EDITOR] Fix move deletion that would sometimes break group-cancels
- [EDITOR] More heavily restrict the data that ccn be written in fields to prevent movesets from breaking
