TekkenMovesetExtractor v0.8.0

Export a moveset by loading up the target characters, then clicking the wanted export button.
Select a moveset in the movelist by clicking on it, then press an import button to import it.

Movesets loaded using the basic "Import to" button will be unloaded after the next loading screen.
If you want the moveset to stay constantly, use the "Monitor" buttons instead of "Import". This is required for online play.

If both online players have loaded the same movesets on the same characters, it should work fine.
The safest thing to do online is to have both players using the exact same moveset.
Online, movesets should be loaded BEFORE the loading screen to avoid desyncs.
