Export a moveset by loading up the target characters, then clicking the wanted export button.
Select a moveset in the movelist by clicking on it, then press an import button to import it.

Movesets loaded using the basic "Import to" button will be unloaded after the next loading screen.
If you want the moveset to stay constantly, use the "Monitor" buttons instead of "Import". This is required for online play.
Both online players must load the same moveset on the same players. The safest thing to do is to use a single moveset for both players.
Movesets should be loaded BEFORE the loading screen, using the Monitor buttons to avoid desyncs.
